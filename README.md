## 🤔 What Does This Skill Do?

You see a social media link but you're too lazy to open it. Or you want to know what a video is about without watching it. This skill solves exactly that:

```
You:    https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cxyz.../

Claude: In this reel, @username introduces a new coffee machine.
        It got 12,432 likes and 248 comments.
        Narration in the video: "With this machine, in 3 minutes, espresso..."
        On screen: La Marzocco Linea Mini device,
        shot in a cafe, price tag 24,500 TL...
```

**4 layers of info from a single link:**
1. 📊 Metadata (who, when, how many likes)
2. 💬 Comments (the most notable ones)
3. 🎙️ Speech transcription (faster-whisper)
4. 👁️ Screen/visual analysis (Gemini Vision)

## 📦 Installation

There are two installation methods. Give the first one to someone who doesn't know what they're doing — Claude asks all the questions. The second is the classic terminal flow.

### Method 1 — With Claude Code (recommended)

If the skill is installed in Claude Code, just type:

```
install the social-media-scraper skill
```

Claude will ask the following in order:
1. Which platforms? (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, YouTube — all or a selection)
2. Should Gemini visual video analysis be enabled? (if yes, asks for the API key)
3. Transcription language? (auto / tr / en / other)

Based on the answers, it installs **only the required tools** and writes the configuration to `~/.social-media-scraper.env`.

### Method 2 — Interactive setup from terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elbis330/social-media-scraper-skill.git
cd social-media-scraper-skill
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` asks the same questions in color, step by step, and installs based on your selections. The configuration is saved to `~/.social-media-scraper.env` (protected with chmod 600).

### Method 3 — Quick, no-questions install

If you want to install all tools without being asked:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elbis330/social-media-scraper-skill.git
cd social-media-scraper-skill
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` asks nothing and installs all tools for all platforms (yt-dlp, instaloader, faster-whisper, google-genai, bird, ffmpeg).

### Manual Installation

#### 1. Place the Skill

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/social-media-scraper
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/social-media-scraper/SKILL.md
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Python packages
pip install yt-dlp instaloader faster-whisper google-genai --break-system-packages

# Node package (for Twitter/X)
npm install -g @steipete/bird

# ffmpeg (for transcription)
brew install ffmpeg          # macOS
sudo apt install ffmpeg      # Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
```

#### 3. Set the Gemini API Key

Get a **free** API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), then:

```bash
echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### 4. Verify

Restart Claude Code and test:

```
Analyze this reel: https://www.instagram.com/reel/EXAMPLE/
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this skill paid?**
A: No. The Gemini API key is free via Google AI Studio (generous quota). Everything else is open source.

**Q: Can it fetch private posts that require login?**
A: No. Only public content. Instagram may ask for cookies in some cases, which can be solved with `--cookies-from-browser chrome`.

**Q: Does transcription support languages other than English?**
A: Yes. faster-whisper supports 99 languages, and the language is auto-detected.

**Q: I don't have a Gemini API key, will it still work?**
A: Yes, but it cannot do visual analysis. Only transcription + metadata + comments will be provided.

**Q: Is there Windows support?**
A: Not tested. The install script is for macOS/Linux. It is expected to work under WSL.
